Telegram Syntaxdb Bot is the official repository for the Syntaxdb Bot on telegram messenger!<br>
So [SyntaxDB](https://syntaxdb.com) is basically a programming search engine that helps you search programming concepts on the go! <br/>

In this project I've integrated the Python Syntaxdb API that I've created! You can check the API that I've built [here](https://github.com/rahulkumaran/python-syntaxdb).<br/>

The usage of this bot is pretty simple.<br/>
There are mainly 3 options here:<br/>
- `/start`
- `/help`
- `/search`


`/start` and `/help` are the basic options!<br/>


### /start
On typing this, you get a welcome message!<br/>

### /help
On typing this you get a message from the bot that tells you about how to use it! Looks exactly like in the image below!<br>

### /search <search query> <language>

So `/search` does the main functionality. Here you have to mention the concept you want to search and mention the language in which you want to search that concept.<br/>

For example:
  ```
  If you want to search the concept of print in java, then you search it this way
  /search for in java
  ```
